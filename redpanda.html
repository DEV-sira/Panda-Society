                            <h3>Why are they endangered?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Red pandas are endangered primarily due to
                                habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human
                                activities such as deforestation, development,
                                and agricultural expansion. The Himalayan
                                region, which is the red panda's natural
                                habitat, has experienced significant
                                deforestation over the years due to logging,
                                fuelwood collection, and the expansion of
                                agricultural land. This has resulted in the
                                fragmentation of the red panda's habitat, which
                                makes it more difficult for them to find food,
                                mate, and move around. <br />

                                Additionally, red pandas are also hunted and
                                poached for their fur, which is highly prized in
                                some cultures. They are also hunted for their
                                meat and body parts, which are used in
                                traditional medicines.
                                <br />
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Climate change is also a significant threat to
                                the survival of red pandas. The changing climate
                                is altering the distribution of bamboo, which is
                                the primary food source for red pandas. The
                                shift in bamboo distribution is affecting the
                                red panda's feeding habits and reproductive
                                success. <br />
                            </p>

                            <h3>Why our ecology needs them?</h3>

                            <p>
                                Red pandas are an important part of the ecology
                                of the Himalayan region, where they are found.
                                As a species that primarily feeds on bamboo,
                                they play a crucial role in maintaining the
                                balance of their ecosystem. By consuming bamboo,
                                red pandas help control the growth of bamboo,
                                preventing it from becoming too dense and
                                crowding out other plant species. This, in turn,
                                helps maintain a diverse range of plant life and
                                supports the survival of other animals that
                                depend on these plants for food and shelter.
                                <br />

                                Furthermore, red pandas also play a role in seed
                                dispersal, as they consume bamboo seeds and then
                                spread them throughout their habitat. This helps
                                support the growth of new bamboo plants and
                                contributes to the regeneration of their
                                ecosystem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As an umbrella species, the conservation of red
                                pandas also helps protect the habitats of other
                                animals and plants in their ecosystem. By
                                protecting red panda habitat, we can also help
                                protect the habitats of other species that rely
                                on the same forest ecosystem for their survival.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In short, red pandas are a crucial component of
                                their ecosystem, playing a critical role in
                                maintaining the balance of their habitat and
                                supporting the survival of other plants and
                                animals. Their conservation is essential for the
                                health and sustainability of the ecosystem in
                                which they live.
